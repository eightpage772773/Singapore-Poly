# believe it or not
Yes SP has classes on saturday (async classes, in the form of online classes.).

# Hi...
This repository is a repo of stuff that tracks all my work in singapore poly. I am a linux-bsd (unix based basically) user and I have no idea how to use something that is not user friendly like windows. Therefor, I have decided to put everything on a familiar environment.

# Windows?
Yuh, apparently it is required by the course or something so LOL.

# How the stuff works...
This repos will have a lot of branches. Like A LOT.     
Essentially:
Every week, there will be 7 folders, representing a day in a week.
Each day will have folders for each subjects and following the TODO standards, we will basically be writing all the details here.

# Public?
Too many things going on at once and the last thing I want is: OH NO! I cannot log in here?!?!?! I need to see some private REPO!       
But if it is public, and I am put in that situation I not only have access, but also a chance at maybe forking/cloning the thing on another device.

# My experience so far...
My experience at SP as a year0 pfp student is pretty dumb so far.           
Already on the 2nd day they wanted us to prepare for a meet up with people from our groups and work on a project.           
In year 0, you basically cannot afford to miss any class, and you have to pay attention. Because if you fail a single module, you cannot repeat PFP and need to go ITE or sec 5.            
I am already at the brink of dropping out in the first week.                
Online services are an absolute mess, I need to figure out how to use brightspace(politemall), outlook, teams, aleks and based on what some seniors told me, more to come. They are not unified and are really hard to navigate.            
This whole thing is a nightmare, things like trying to click on the login button triggers the hover event for a dropdown menu, preventing you from logging in at all. I really wanna cry. Why is it all so difficult to use?               
That said, A lot of info comes at you at once and it is VERY overwhelming. I have honestly no idea what the hell is going on 100% of the time.
